## Why Ski Sloth?
People in Minneapolis, Minnesota love to embrace winter.  #boldnorth!
Unfortunately, the effects of climate change can have a negative impact on our winter activities. This year,  snowfall has been minimal, and local skiers have had to rely upon snow-making operations at parks in order to cross-country ski. 

This Alexa skill makes it easy to get the latest conditions for the snow-making trails at Theodore Wirth Park. In addition, this skill uses Alexa Presentation Language to display the current trail webcam image, allowing the latest trail conditions to be shown on many different devices.

I built the Ski Sloth project myself as a volunteer and this project is not associated with the Loppet Foundation nor the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board.
